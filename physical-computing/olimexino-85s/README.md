=============

The [olimexino s85](https://www.olimex.com/Products/Duino/AVR/OLIMEXINO-85S/open-source-hardware) is a very tiny cheap (5€) protoboard based on the Attiny 85 chip. It has not all the capabilities of an full arduino board but it is equipped with an li-poly adapter and can be programmed via USB.  

See the [pin layout here](https://www.olimex.com/Products/Duino/AVR/OLIMEXINO-85S/resources/OLIMEXINO-85s_pinout.jpg) and read the [hookup guide here](http://digistump.com/wiki/digispark/tutorials/connecting#your_first_upload)  

Download the costum [Arduino IDE here](http://digistump.com/wiki/digispark/tutorials/connecting) and get the [examples here](https://www.olimex.com/Products/Duino/AVR/OLIMEXINO-85-ASM/resources/ATtiny85_demos.zip)
