Ideation exercise
=================

Concepts generated using one random technology and three random parameters in 3 rounds (see the cards inside the [idea-generator](https://github.com/FH-Potsdam/2014-2015-WiSe-15PP-PW-DIY-Multitouch/tree/master/ideation/idea-generator) folder)

## Round 1

### Slim Jumber
__Tech:__ Optical
__Params:__ Size, Volume
